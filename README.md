Hey there! 👋

I’m a Computer Science student and an aspiring backend & Data Engineer.

I build backend applications and REST APIs using Java and Spring Boot, and I am currently learning MuleSoft to deepen my API integration skills and moving towards Data engineering using java as core tech stack.

I enjoy learning by building real projects and improving my problem-solving skills.

My main tech stack includes Java, Spring Boot, MuleSoft(Basic) , and PostgreSQL .

My favorite tools are  VS Code, Intellij Idea , Postman, Git, and GitHub.

I’m currently strengthening my expertise in backend development, data engineering technologies, API integration, and problem-solving through DSA.
